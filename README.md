Hello World.

A time-honored tradition in the world of computer science is the "Hello World" application.
It is a name given the first program that almost any student writes.
It is an important and memorable event, as it marks their forray into the domain of programming.
It will be the first time they learn that their writing(code) can directly translate into actions taken by a machine.
This will be the start of a whole new life for those for whom this experience proves intoxicating.

A little about me(0-Dawg!).

I'm a self-taught coder looking to make a better life for myself.
I enjoy robotics, automation, animation, and the various arts.
I personally play two instuments - Piano and Guitar.
I currently work as a professional artist in Toronto, creating Animation and Concept art for a to-remain-unnamed production house.
I first started coding when I began modifying my Action Replay device for the Nintendo Gamecube.
The first feature I wrote delved into the files of Zelda:Wind-Waker and changed Zelda's name into "Jesus". I was 14.
I like contributing to open-source projects because I just can't resist that siren's call of "But woulden't it be neat if...".
